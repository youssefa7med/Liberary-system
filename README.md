# Library System

This project is a console-based Library Management System developed in Python. The system allows users to manage a collection of books, handle borrowing and returning operations, and maintain a record of users and their transactions.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register users and maintain user records.
- **Borrowing and Returning**: Users can borrow and return books, with the system updating the inventory accordingly.
- **Transaction History**: Track the borrowing and returning history for each user.
- **Search Functionality**: Efficiently search for books by title, author, or ISBN.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for development.
- **File Handling**: For persisting data on books, users, and transactions.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Implemented using OOP principles for better code organization and reusability.
